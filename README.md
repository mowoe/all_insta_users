## :warning: It is not ensured, that this still works, as Instagram updates its API from time to time
# all_insta_users
Sometimes you just feel like you have to know all instagram Users? Well, watch this.


Please dont do this with your real Instagram Account as ist will get banned really quickly.
But with the create_user script you can create as many users as you want.

## Instagram blocking you

As far as I know there are five types of Instagram blocking you:

1. ### Please try again
+ This is the first step to get banned. You will get a message like "Please wait a few minutes before you try again."
+ This usually occurs when you are too fast with your request, it is enough to put a little delay before the requests, you will see this for a short time and it is linked to your account, not your ip.

2. ### Rate Limited
+ This is when you are doing too many requests per second and is basically the same thing as 1.

3. ### Checkpoint required
+ This usually happens when you are creating an Account from a flagged IP, then your account is basically gone because you need to add a phone number and verify it.
+ You cant do anything against that, other than not creating too many accounts from one IP per hour

4. ### Account disabled
+ This usually happens when you received 1. or 2. too often, then your account gets disabled and is from there unusable.

5. ### IP flagged
+ When you create too many accounts or make too many requests from one IP, your IP gets flagged and every account created from this IP has then problem 3.
+ When the IP is flagged, sometimes 3. gets added to the account afterwards, even when it was created from a clean IP and only logged in from the flagged IP
